# ðŸŽ¥ Anime Recommendation System

This project builds an **Anime Recommendation System** using machine learning and data analysis on the [Anime Dataset](anime.csv).  
It analyzes anime ratings, genres, and user preferences to generate meaningful recommendations.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Anime dataset (`anime.csv`)  
- **Key Columns:**
  - `anime_id`: Unique identifier for each anime  
  - `name`: Title of the anime

## Tools & Libraries

- `pandas` â€“ Data processing and manipulation  
- `numpy` â€“ Numerical operations  
- `matplotlib` â€“ Data visualization  
- `seaborn` â€“ Statistical data visualization  
- `scikit-learn` â€“ Machine learning (cosine similarity, recommendation models)  
- `statistics` â€“ Standard Python library 
- `operator` â€“ Standard Python library  
- `warnings` â€“ Standard Python library

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values (e.g., unknown episode counts).  
   - Converted genres into structured features.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of anime types, ratings, genres, and episodes.  
   - Visualizations to uncover trends.  

3. **Recommendation System**  
   - Built using **Collaborative Filtering** & **Cosine Similarity**.  
   - Recommends anime based on user preferences and similarity scores.

## Key Insights
- **Most common genres:** Action, Comedy, Drama.  
- **Highest average ratings:** Long-running TV anime often maintain popularity.  
- **Episodes trend:** 12â€“26 episode TV series dominate seasonal releases.  
- **User preferences:** Similar users rate anime alike, making collaborative filtering effective.
